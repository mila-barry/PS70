#### Week 2: The Honey Hive 

[pressfit construction project]

<span>I came into this class with a little bit of Fusion360 experience, but can happily say that I am much more comfortable with the software after this week! Whereas before I had only built objects from templated parts I can now construct from scratch and have a better understanding of the considerations that must be made to effectively move an object from digital to physical. I also learned how to work with vector images.</span>

<span>the idea</span>

When I checked out examples of previous press fit construction projects, I couldn’t help but think about how much their modular pieces resembled honeycomb. The only thing missing was the bees! So I decided to make a hive of my own, complete with attachable insects.   
 
<span>the hive</span> 

The hive is constructed from a single hexagonal piece with six notches, which I created in Fusion360. It is 46mm at its widest point, with a 10mm notch depth, and 3.8 mm notch width. I initially set the notch width to 4mm, but subtracted 0.2mm at the end to account for kerf. Each of the 12 edges is about 8.6mm (before I added the notches — when it was a complete hexagon — they were 20mm each). Thanks to Kassia for technical support in those final software steps!

<span>the bees</span> 

The bees are modeled from a vector image that I found online in the Creative Commons. I downloaded the image, used a web based converter to change the format to an .svg file, and then uploaded it to Fusion360. I was then able to scale it down, extrude it, and add a small rectangular hole in its head into which a connecting piece could be inserted (allowing me to attach the soon-to-be cardboard bugs to my hive). The bee design is very small; 17mm at its longest point and 26mm at its widest. The connecting notch is 2.0mm by 0.9mm.

<span>the bee connector</span>

The bee connector piece was probably the simplest to create. It is a 6mm by 4mm rectangle, with a 2mm by 1mm rectangle centered on top of one of the longer edges. The larger rectangle slides into the notches on the hexagon pieces, while the smaller one slides into the notches on the bees, thus joining the hive and its inhabitants.

<span>printing</span>

The printing process went shockingly smoothly. Never once has every piece of my design laser cut correctly on the first try, but this time they did! I simply emailed them to myself, opened them on Rhino, and sent them to the machine. Euphoric experience :)
