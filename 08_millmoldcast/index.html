#### Week 8: Silicone Typeform

<span>The idea:</span>
I really wanted to use the vacuum sealer and the silicone casting kit for my work this week. Freshman year my friend took an art class and did lots of silicone casting and I’ve been curious about it ever since. She made lots of rubber hands (they were kind of creepy) but I decided to take a less anatomical route and do something related to my final project. 

Back in the day, printing presses required typefaces, essentially physical stamps of the letters that could be rearranged infinitely to create text. I’m not sure how I will go about creating a typeface for my printing press. But this week is an experiment in one way it could possibly be done. I cast 4 oversized letters in silicone and plan to use them to test if my next final project prototype can exert enough pressure to transfer ink. I’m happy to announce that it was a pretty straightforward process.       

<span>The 3D print:</span>
I started by finding some free vector images of various fonts on the internet. I downloaded one that I liked, converted it from a .eps to a .svg and then uploaded it to Fusion360. From there, I deleted all the letters except the ones in my first name and extruded them to 3mm. Then I did Save as Mesh and sent the file over to Prusa. It was a 24 minute print.

<span>The vacuum sealed mold:</span> 
After my letters were done printing, I used the small vacuum sealing machine to convert them into a mold. I think I let the plastic get a little too soft and I also think I could have extruded the letter to be taller because they were very hard to extract. I did it in the end though! And there was not too much distortion in the mold!

<span>The silicone cast:</span>
I mixed up equal parts of solutions A and B from the silicone casting kit and poured it into the plastic mold I had just finished.

After waiting overnight, I took the casts out of the mold and inked them using water based acrylic paint. I pressed them on a piece of computer paper using my hands and got a pretty clean transfer (especially considering that I'll be using actual ink rather than paint in my final). The fatal mistake is that I didn't realize that I would only be able to use one side of the casts to print from. And of course, the working side is the front, not the back. So I can only print letters than reversed (mirror images) of the way they should. That's an easy fix, though, I just need to remake the mold.

As soon as the next prototype of my final project is complete, I will use my sample typeface to test its ability to do a rubber to paper ink transfer. Yay!
