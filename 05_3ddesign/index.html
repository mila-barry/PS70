#### Week 5: Main Press Bed & Stamp Securing Mechanism

[3D design project]  

<span>! photo of printed items coming soon !</span>

<span>The idea:</span>
This week’s assignment is the first iteration of the main body of my final project. I’ve changed the basic design of the body of the press; instead of a tabletop platen press I’m going to make a tabletop version of the more famous flatbed press design. I think the physical mechanisms of the flatbed press will be easier to construct on Fusion360 while the complexity of the software and coding will not increase too much. The update to my final project page is coming! And the photos of the initial (hopefully successful) 3D print will be added to this page as soon as I’m able to stop by the lab hours. 

<span>The process:</span> 
The flatbed press plate is designed in 3 parts: the main press bed, piece one of the stamp securing mechanism, and piece two of the stamp securing mechanism. I did each in a separate file to keep things clean so I’ll divide my explanation by part.  

<span>The main press bed:</span>
The main press bed is a rectangle (dimensions: 0.125in by 6in by 8in), raised a quarter of an inch off the ground on 3 sides to create an accessible hollow space on the underside. There are also two rectangular holes (dimensions: 0.5 in by 5.5in & 4.5in respectively), aligned with the inside upper edge and left edge. These holes are to house the stamp securing mechanism, which I’ll explain later. Finally, there are raised rails on three sides of the press bed (both long sides and one short side). The rails on the long side have a 7.5in by 0.125 in by 0.25in rectangular hole, which will eventually serve as notches for the axis that will hold the breyer (aka ink roller). See the final product in the photos below.

<span>Piece one of the stamp securing mechanism:</span>
The stamp securing mechanism is a small element that’s inserted into the holes in the main press bed (let’s call them runners). They slide back and forth on the runners to secure the stamp that is placed on the bed, ensuring it doesn’t wiggle when pressure is applied by the breyer. The stamp securing mechanism is important because it allows one press to print stamps of many sizes. This is the main way it exceeds the capabilities of the platen press in my original design. 

The stamp securing mechanism is composed of a rectangular base (dimensions: 0.25in by 0.25in by 1in), a rectangular neck piece (dimensions: 0.20in by 0.125in by 0.125in), and a rectangular holder piece (1in by 0.125in by 0.02in). These three rectangles are stacked on top of each other facing the same direction. When turned to the orientation where the long sides run along the y-axis, the complete element can be inserted into a runner. Once in the runner, it can then be turned 90 degrees, so that the short sides run along the y-axis and the piece can no longer slip out. When inserted and rotated properly, the base will take up space on the hollow underside of the main press bed, the neck will extend through the bed itself, and the holder will make contact with the stamp.

<span>Piece two of the securing mechanism:</span>
Piece two of the securing mechanism is essentially a jam to keep piece one from coming loose. It's an extruded ellipse with a width just under 0.5in and a length just over it (and a height of 0.3in), so that the piece can slip into the runners and then be rotated slightly to lock in place. I’ll lock them in right behind piece one of the stamp securing mechanism to keep piece one from sliding away from the stamp.

I know all of this is probably hard to visualize, but I promise I’ll have the printed version with a video of all the pieces together up on my page soon.
