#### Week 12: Printing press plan! 

It's been a rough week of assignments and I haven’t had a chance to update my MVP :( I did have a chance to make a general outline of what needs to be done to get to the next stage though! And I’ll catch up this weekend. 

<span>Mechanics</span>
After learning how to make the drawing machine, I’ve realized that a lot of the mechanical structures could inform the way that I build my printing press. The back-and-forth motion of the stepper motor attached to the belt is doing just what my stepper motor will do when attached to the breyer. My materials are listed below, along with my build priorities for the next few days (thanks bobby!), and a sketch to help visualize it.  
  
    Materials I need to get:
      2 pieces of aluminum extrusion (at least 13 inches in length, to comfortably fit a piece of standard computer paper)
      2 rubber belts/the metal pulleys that connect the belt to the stepper motor 
      4-8 runner wheels, to guide the breyer along the grooves of the aluminum extrusion  
      Bearings, at least 2 
      Screws, a drill, and potentially the water jet (is that the right tool?) to cut the aluminum extrusion 

    Materials I need to fabricate:
      A piece to connect my stepper motors to the aluminum extrusion 
      A piece to connect the breyer to the runner wheels
      A piece to connect the two pieces of aluminum extrusion  
      An improved pressbed to secure the typeform 
      An improved type form sample 

<span>TOP PRIORITIES</span><br>
Measure/cut aluminum extrusion<br>
Design and build breyer to stepper motor connector<br> 
Design and build stepper motor to machine skeleton connector<br>

<span>Code</span>
I already have code to make the breyer move back and forth, as well as change directions. At the minimum, there is at least 1 new feature I want to add to the next version of my project (more in the future). That feature is a couple of preset buttons that, when pressed, will tell the breyer to move back and forth across the paper a specific number of times. For example, button 1 might initiate 4 swipes while button 2 only initiates 2. I also need to add a limit switch. But this is not current a priority, as I need to focus on the build.     

<span>LEVEL UP OPTIONS</span>
Add a touch sensitive feature where the rolling process initiates as soon as a piece of paper is applied 
Add a height adjustment feature so that different weights of paper and typeforms can be accommodated 
Add a second breyer, so that the machine can apply ink and the make the print, rather than just the latter
